			<h1>About</h1>
			<h3>Fine, I'll admit it: I'm Cheppy Sofyan.</h3>
			<p>I'm a UX/UI designer and web developer living in Bogor. I like it here because it's usually pretty cool but not too cool where I worry about wearing shorts and junk.</p>
			<p>I was always interested in art, industrial design, architecture, cartography and i loved computers. I tinkered with them, played games, tried to figure out how and why programs worked the way they did, and it was there that I discovered I could combine my love for technology with my love for design.</p>
